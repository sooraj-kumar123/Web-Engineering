            <h3>Super Store Management System</h3>
            <img src="Project2 Image .jpg" alt="Project 2">
            <p>Upon observing our surroundings, we noticed that many local and yet-growing superstore owners are still
                working manually, using registers and journals to maintain their routine data. The owners of non well
                known superstore (which are many in number) are either unaware of the database management system or
                choose not to implement that into their businesses for one of the reasons to be complex to use.</p>
